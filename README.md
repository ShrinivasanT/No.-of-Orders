# Supplement Sales Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict supplement sales using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. The dataset contains various features related to sales patterns.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Loading and cleaning sales data using Pandas
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Checking missing values, statistical insights
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting relevant features for prediction
- **Model Training**: Using Scikit-Learn models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or LightGBM)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE (Mean Absolute Error), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/supplement-sales-prediction.git
   cd supplement-sales-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook No._of_Orders.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset should be placed in the root directory as `Supplement.csv`.

## Model Performance
The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Ensure proper feature selection to improve accuracy.
